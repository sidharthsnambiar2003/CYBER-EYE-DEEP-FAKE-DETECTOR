# üß† CyberEye - Deepfake Detection App

CyberEye is a smart web application that detects deepfake content in uploaded videos by analyzing facial landmarks and their consistency using deep learning and clustering techniques. Built with Flask and OpenCV, it offers a user-friendly interface to upload videos, extract frames, analyze faces, and display a deepfake classification summary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### 1. üì¶ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cybereye.git
cd cybereye
```

### 2. üêç Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. üì• Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure you also install OpenCV and dlib system dependencies (see below).

---

## üß∞ Dlib & OpenCV Setup

**Linux/macOS**
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
pip install dlib opencv-python
```

**Windows**
- Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
- Then install:
```bash
pip install dlib==19.24.0
pip install opencv-python
```

---

## üß† Dlib Landmark Model

Download the required model manually:

```bash
mkdir model
cd model
wget http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
bzip2 -d shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è MySQL Setup

### 1. Login to MySQL and create DB

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cyber_eye;
```

### 2. Run the SQL schema (optional)

Use the provided `schema.sql` to create all 6 required tables:

```sql
-- user, video, frame, face, analysis_result, video_result
```

### 3. Update `db.py` with your credentials:
```python
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_mysql_password'
```

|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/`           | Redirect to login / index              |
| `/register`   | Register a new user                    |
| `/login`      | Login with username or email           |
| `/index`      | Upload video + deepfake detection      |
| `/uploads`    | Manage uploaded videos                 |
| `/blog`       | Read about deepfakes                   |
| `/logout`     | End user session                       |

---

## üìå Notes

- All uploaded videos are saved in `/uploads/`
- Frames are saved under `/frames/{video_name}/`
- MySQL stores metadata; no video is deleted from DB, only removed from disk

---

## üß™ Sample Use Case

1. Register an account  
2. Upload a video  
3. Frames are extracted and analyzed  
4. Deepfake probability is estimated  
5. Results shown with colored frame borders  
6. Manage uploads or read the blog to learn more
